### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

Scarlett is my personal alarm clock project, designed to
- Be your alarm clock! (wow)
- Display next bus time (Singapore, after you tell it your bus stop and service number)
- Show weather
- More features that can aid with easing into sleep etc. 

The clock is designed for ipadOS, and mainly will be used at night during sleep (hence not all day), features cater to be sleep friendly


This project is heavily WIP, and i'm still learning :)
